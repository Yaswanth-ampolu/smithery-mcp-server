# Important Files

These files should be included in every chat for context.

- `package.json` - Project configuration and dependencies
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `src/main.ts` - Entry point for the MCP server
- `src/system.ts` - System utility functions for interacting with the local machine
- `public/index.html` - Web client interface for testing the MCP server
- `.gitignore` - Files to ignore in Git
- `.env` - Environment variables and configuration (not tracked in Git)

**Note:** When new important files are added to the project, they should be added to this list.
