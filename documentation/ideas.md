# MCP Server Tool Ideas

This document lists potential new tools to enhance the capabilities of the MCP server, focusing on terminal commands, file system interactions, and process management.

## Existing Tools

1. `runShellCommand`: Execute arbitrary shell commands.
2. `runPythonFile`: Execute a specific Python script.
3. `readDirectory`: List contents of a directory.
4. `copyFile`: Copy a file.
5. `createFile`: Create a new file with content.

## Integration Summary

- **Fully Integrable (Low Complexity)**: 18 tools
- **Not Implementing**: 4 tools

Most proposed tools can be integrated into the MCP server architecture with reasonable effort. The implementation should follow a phased approach, starting with the file operations and progressing to more specialized tools. We've removed some tools that are not needed for current use cases or would require complex implementation.
