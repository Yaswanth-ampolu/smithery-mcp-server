## Integration Analysis

After reviewing the codebase and the proposed tools, we've determined that all tools can be integrated into the MCP server architecture. The existing implementation provides a solid foundation with:

1. **Workspace Path Resolution**: The system already handles workspace paths correctly
2. **Cross-Platform Support**: The code includes platform-specific handling
3. **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling patterns are established
4. **MCP Server Integration**: The pattern for adding new tools is clear
